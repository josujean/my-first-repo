### About me

I started new job 3 weeks ago. It's a very different environment from where I was before so I'm trying to learn everything.
Git is one of them so this is my practice repo and this README.md is my practice markdown.

### Movies

I love scary movies. Can't say there are many good ones out there, but the most recent one I really enjoyed *Us*. Among others are:

- *It Follows*
- *Babadook*

### Food

Eating, cooking, and grocery shopping are my daily activities. Noodles are my favorite kind of food. To list:

1. Janchi-gooksu
2. Kal-gooksu
3. Ramen
4. Nengmyun
5. Udon
